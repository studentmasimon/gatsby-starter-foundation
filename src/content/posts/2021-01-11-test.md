Fall 2017

I was assigned the task of creating a database with Microsoft Access that included knowledge of tables, queries, forms, and reports aimed towards students and teachers of UCF to manage classes.


It features a fully working Switchboard/Menu with layers of navigation for various forms, reports, and queries for either students or teachers to use their respective forms.


Each table and query has unique characteristics that were filled out with content that was generated from a database of potential inputs that were formatted accordingly.


Students could fill out a form for a potential project and have teachers approve or disprove based on the content provided.

**Teacher Input**

Alongside various reports for each table/form/query.

Pretty cool project to do on my own. I liked the integration of GUI and the visual functionality of the database. Microsoft Access is a user-friendly way to get into queries and database entries/tables.
