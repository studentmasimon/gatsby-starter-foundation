The Gatsby documentation is a ***must*** for getting things running.

The theme for this website is "Gatsby Starter Foundation" by @Stackrole .

I chose it from this website : <https://templates.netlify.com/template/foundation-gatsby-netlifycms-starter/>

This YouTube video was a great quick little overview that helped me get going : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHWBPj-v028>

I'd like to thank **Netlify** for providing free hosting for websites; I looked around and it wouldn't be worthwhile to pay for hosting and a domain that would get little to no traffic.
